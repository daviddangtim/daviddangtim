- 👋 Hi, I’m @daviddangtim
- 👀 I’m interested in game development, but too scared to start because it looks hard
- 🌱 I’m currently learning backend development in node js using express, and Golang on the side.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that'll give me experience
- 📫 message me on instagram @daviddangtim or on reddit @dizzydaviddee
